A comprehensive system design and specification for a **Tennis Tournament Management Software**, developed as part of the Software Engineering course of Warsaw's Polytechnic during my Erasmus semester. This project demonstrates professional UML modeling practices and complete system architecture design using industry-standard tools.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project presents a full-scale UML model for a tennis tournament management system, covering all aspects from user interactions to system deployment. The design follows software engineering best practices and provides a complete blueprint for developing a real-world tournament management application.

**Key Features Modeled:**
- Tournament creation and management
- Player registration and management  
- Match scheduling and court assignment
- Real-time match tracking and result entry
- Comprehensive user role management (Organizers, Referees, Players)

A comprehensive system design and specification for a **Tennis Tournament Management Software**, developed as part of the Software Engineering course of Warsaw's Polytechnic during my Erasmus semester. This project demonstrates professional UML modeling practices and complete system architecture design using industry-standard tools.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project presents a full-scale UML model for a tennis tournament management system, covering all aspects from user interactions to system deployment. The design follows software engineering best practices and provides a complete blueprint for developing a real-world tournament management application.

**Key Features Modeled:**
- Tournament creation and management
- Player registration and management  
- Match scheduling and court assignment
- Real-time match tracking and result entry
- Comprehensive user role management (Organizers, Referees, Players)

## üìã System Features & Use Cases

The system design covers **15 comprehensive use cases** organized by functional areas:

### **üèÜ Tournament Management (UC1-UC3)**
- **UC1: Create Tournament** - Initialize new tournaments with parameters
- **UC2: Manage Tournament Info** - Update tournament details and settings
- **UC3: Manage Player Applications** - Handle player registration requests

### **üë• Player Registration & Management (UC4-UC6)**  
- **UC4: Register as Player** - New user registration in the system
- **UC5: Register for Tournament** - Player enrollment in specific tournaments
- **UC6: Withdraw from Tournament** - Handle player withdrawals and substitutions

### **üéØ Match Organization & Scheduling (UC7-UC8)**
- **UC7: Generate Match Draw** - Create tournament brackets and pairings
- **UC8: Assign Court and Match Times** - Schedule matches with court assignments

### **‚ö° Match Execution & Results (UC9-UC13)**
- **UC9: Enter Match Result** - Record match outcomes and scores
- **UC10: User is logged in** - Authentication and session management
- **UC11: Notify players and users** - Communication and alert system
- **UC12: Update Player Rankings** - Automatic ranking calculations
- **UC13: Show detailed statistics of the match** - Comprehensive match analytics

### **üìä Information Access & Reporting (UC14-UC15)**
- **UC14: View Tournament Schedule** - Display tournament timeline and matches
- **UC15: View Results and Rankings** - Tournament standings and player statistics
